# Film-List-Application (Academic Project)
This program is an implementation of a film database application using MVC architecture. The FruitList GUI 
was provided as a starting point. The application allows the user to perform the below functionalities via 
a GUI:
• View the list of all films stored in the database
• Add new films to the list
• Delete existing films from the list
• Filter the list of films according to a search term
• Read a text file database when the application starts
• Save the text file database when the application exits
